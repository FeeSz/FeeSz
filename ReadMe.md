# üí´ About Me:
I'm Felype Souza, a high school senior currently completing my technical course in Information Technology at Col√©gio Victorino. Over the past year, I have been deeply engaged in developing my skills in programming, networking, and system management. Technology has always been a field that inspires me, and I am constantly looking to expand my knowledge through practical projects and continuous learning. As I approach graduation, I am motivated to build a strong career in IT, combining the solid theoretical foundation I've acquired with real-world experience. I'm passionate about staying updated with the latest tech trends and applying innovative solutions to challenges. üöÄ
